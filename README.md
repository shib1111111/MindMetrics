# MindMetrics: Mental Health Analytics of Tweets

This repository introduces a cutting-edge, modular framework for classifying tweets into mental health categories using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It serves as both an educational resource and a robust baseline for computational mental health research.


## Key Highlights

- **Diverse Model Architectures:**  
  Leverage a range of modern techniques including transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT, XLNet, GPT-2), zero-shot classification, topic modeling (LDA, NMF), and a rule-based classifier. This variety supports in-depth comparative analysis between contemporary and conventional methods.

- **Comprehensive End-to-End Pipeline:**  
  The framework spans from raw data ingestion and rigorous preprocessing to model evaluation and result visualization, offering a complete walkthrough of an ML workflow.

- **Reproducible & Extensible Research:**  
  With clearly defined modules and scripts, researchers can easily replicate results, benchmark performance, and extend the pipeline for custom experiments.

- **Advanced Technical Capabilities:**  
  Incorporates techniques such as GPU acceleration, mixed precision training, and extensive metric evaluations (ROC, Precision-Recall curves, classification reports) to offer deeper insights into model behavior.

- **Real-World Application:**  
  Provides practical strategies for handling noisy social media data, including sophisticated preprocessing, feature engineering, and robust evaluation methodologies.


## Repository Structure

### Data Preparation

- **Raw Data:**  
  The primary dataset (`mental.csv`) consists of unprocessed tweets.

- **Preprocessing Scripts:**  
  Clean and normalize text data by removing noise (e.g., mentions, URLs, digits, non-alphabetic characters), followed by tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword filtering.

### Modeling and Classification

- **Transformer-Based Models:**  
  Fine-tune and deploy BERT, DistilBERT, XLNet, and GPT-2 for high-performance text classification.

- **Zero-Shot Classification:**  
  Utilize transfer learning to predict labels without requiring explicit training on every category.

- **Topic Modeling:**  
  Implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to reveal latent structures and cluster similar content.

- **Rule-Based Approach:**  
  Employ a simple yet effective classifier based on token occurrence for initial categorization.

### Evaluation and Analysis

- **Performance Metrics:**  
  Measure model effectiveness using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

- **Visualization Tools:**  
  Generate ROC and Precision-Recall curves, histograms, word clouds, and n-gram analyses to visually interpret data insights.

- **Comparative Analysis:**  
  Conduct detailed, side-by-side comparisons of model outputs with comprehensive classification reports.


## Technical Requirements

- **Programming Language:**  
  Python (3.7+)

- **Development Environment:**  
  Google Colab or any Jupyter Notebook setup with GPU support.

- **Core Libraries:**  
  - **Data Handling:** `pandas`, `numpy`
  - **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `WordCloud`
  - **NLP & ML:** `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `transformers`, `tensorflow`, `torch`

- **API Integrations:**  
  Support for API-driven classification via OpenAI and Google Generative AI.
